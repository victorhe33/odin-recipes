    <div class="paragraph">
        <p>I created this recipe from looking at a few different ones online and choosing my favorite aspects of each. This is 
           vegetarian but there are many bibimbap recipes with beef or chicken marinades, if you want to add beef or chicken to
           this dish.</p>

    </div>

    <div class="list">
        <ol>
        <li>Heat sesame oil in a large skillet over medium heat; cook and stir carrot and zucchini in the hot oil until vegetables
        begin to soften, about 5 minutes. Stir in bean sprouts, bamboo shoots, and mushrooms. Cook and stir until carrots are
        tender, about 5 more minutes. Season to taste with salt and set vegetables aside.</li>
        <li>Stir cooked rice, green onions, soy sauce, and black pepper in the same skillet until the rice is hot. In a separate
        skillet over medium heat, melt butter and gently fry eggs, turning once, until the yolks are still slightly runny but
        the egg whites are firm, about 3 minutes per egg.</li>
        <li>To serve, divide hot cooked rice mixture between 3 serving bowls and top each bowl with 1/3 of the vegetable mixture and
        a fried egg. Serve sweet red chili sauce on the side for mixing into bibimbap.</li>
